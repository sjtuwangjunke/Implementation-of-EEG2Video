# SEED-DV EEG-VP Scripts
This repository provides a lightweight PyTorch implementation for decoding gaze **vision** (V) and **position** (P) information from multi-channel EEG signals, including EEG models and training code.

## Quick Start
First change the paths of the dataset, output directory and the result directory to your own.

Then run 
```bash
python EEG_VP_train_test.py
```
